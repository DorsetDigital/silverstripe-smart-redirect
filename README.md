#silverstripe-smart-redirect

This module provides an interface to create and manage URL redirects based on a number of criteria.

Initially designed to work as an easy method for generating and deploying QR codes, the module can find applications anywhere that conditional redirection may be required (such as URl shorteners, etc.)

Tools are included for redirection based on the browser language, and the user's geolocation (IP based using Maxmind).   A default redirection rule is also included.  Time-based redirects will be available in a future release.
